Bala Karthik M -- Screening Test(Tandemloop)

Language Used -- Python in VS-Code

How to run the file : 
*python Problem-1.py
*python Problem-2.py
*python Problem-3.py
*python Problem-4.py

in Problem-1.py
# Problem-1.py
# First problem - Simple Calcluaator using class - class name Calculator 
# For Double i imported double from matplotlib.pylab
# Inputs : a --> double , b --> double , c --> string

in Problem-2.py
#Problem-2.py

# Second problem - With a single integer as the input --> generate the following until a = x [1,3,5,...,x]

# Output : a list of odd numbers from 1 to x 

#Example : 
# a = 1 -> 1
# a = 3 -> 1,3,5

#here i am taking input and generating the list of odd numbers
#I am using the formula for generating odd numbers : 2 * n - 1 where n
#Here i am using string join to print the list in the desired format


in Problem-3.py
#Problem-3.py
#input: a --> as integer
#Output : odd number series from 1 to n with thw given length : 

#Rules as mentioned on the problem statement
# if a is odd --> a terms needs to print
# if a is even --> a+1 terms needs to print

#Examples: 
# a = 1 --> 1
# a = 2 --> 1
# a = 3 --> 1,3,5
# a = 4 --> 1,3,5
# a = 5 --> 1,3,5,7,9
# a = 6 --> 1,3,5,7,9


#Here for the output I'm using the same logic as in Problem-2.py to generate odd numbers also that the same join method to print the list in desired format


in Problem-4.py
#Problem-4.py
# Fourth problem - Get the total count of number listed in the dictionary which is multiple of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# Input : A list of integers [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]
# Output : {1:11,2:8,3:4,4:4,5:3,6:2,7:0,8:1,9:1}
    # sir! here the input format must be in the form of comma separated values without spaces
    # example : 1,2,3,4,5,6
